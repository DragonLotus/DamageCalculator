To Do:

Orb Match Page
-Maybe make a button to link to enemy page. Gotta figure out how to link shit.

Enemy Page
-add defense break (Radiogroup or dropdown menu)
?gravity scrolling buttons (for smaller devices)
-element reduction (Selections)
-damage absorbtion over X damage (like sopdet) (EditText)
-element absorb (Selections? Can there be more than 1?)
-set up fragments with the buttons and adapter
X apply button = takes all the gravity and adjust the current hp of the enemy
	-now applies automatically. Added a clear button instead.
-Need to add that unfocus when keyboard hidden shit as well.

Calculations Page
-Make it

Monster Page
-unfocus when keyboard is hidden (when pressing back)
-Latent awakenings when they come/translated.

Maybe
-tank calculator
-poison orbs
